## The `process_data()` documentation

This package provides a general function `process_data()` for the
pre-analysis processing of omics data (e.g., metabolomics/proteomics).
All processing steps are optional and can be tailored to the users
specific requirements. This function performs the following processing
steps (in order):

1. Excludes features with extreme missingness based on a specified
   threshold
2. Excludes samples with extreme missingness based on a specified
   threshold
3. Imputes missing values using various methods
4. Transforms the data using specified methods
5. Excludes outlying samples using PCA and LOF
6. Handles case-control data to ensure matched samples are treated
   appropriately
7. Corrects for plate effects using specified random and fixed effects
8. Centers and scales the data

Requires 3 data frames:

1. feature data
   - column 1 = sample IDs; column 2-N = features
   - example data: `data("data_features")`
2. feature meta-data
   - column 1 = feature column names; column 2-N = feature information
     (e.g., % missing, LOD)
   - example data: `data("data_meta_features")`
3. sample meta-data
   - column 1 = sample IDs; column 2-N = sample information (e.g.,
     batch, age, sex)
   - example data: `data("data_meta_samples")`

Returns a list of:

1. `df_features`: processed feature dataframe
2. `df_meta_samples`: filtered sample meta-data
3. `df_meta_features`: filteres feature meta-data
4. `plot_samples_outlier`: figure of PCA/LOF analysis
5. `id_exclusions`: a list of IDs:
   - `id_features_exclude`: feature IDs excluded for extreme sample
     missingness
   - `id_samples_exclude`: sample IDs excluded for extreme sample
     missingness
   - `id_samples_outlier`: sample IDs excluded in PCA/LOF analysis
   - `id_samples_casecontrol`: sample IDs excluded because a matched
     case-control was excluded

## How

All arguments are independent and examples are given below. Each
function (e.g., `impute_data()`) can be used independently of
`process_data()`

### Sample and feature exclusions for >10% missingness

```{r eval=FALSE}
data_processed <- process_data(
  data = data_features, 
  col_samples = "ID_sample", 
  exclusion_extreme_feature = TRUE, missing_pct_feature = 0.1,
  exclusion_extreme_sample = TRUE, missing_pct_sample = 0.1)

# Exclusion features: excluding features with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion features: excluded 44 feature(s) 
# Exclusion samples: excluding samples with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion samples: excluded 15 sample(s) 
### total feature(s) excluded = 44 
### total sample(s) excluded = 15 
# returning a list of data and exclusion IDs
```

### Imputation of missing feature data

```{r eval=FALSE}
> data_processed <- process_data(
+   data = data_features, 
+   col_samples = "ID_sample", 
+   imputation = TRUE, imputation_method = "mean")

## Imputation using mean 
### total feature(s) excluded = 0 
### total sample(s) excluded = 0 
# returning a list of data and exclusion IDs
```

If imputing using limit of detection (LOD) or equivalent, you must
provide a feature meta-data file which contains a column with feature
names and a column of LOD or equivalent:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data_processed <- process_data(
  data = data_features, 
  data_meta_features = data_meta_features, col_features = "ID_feature", col_LOD = "LOD",
  col_samples = "ID_sample", 
  imputation = TRUE, imputation_method = "LOD")
```

### Transformation of feature data

Ttransformation by all `log10` methods will also perform centering and
scaling to a mean of 0

```{r eval=FALSE}
> data_processed <- process_data(
+   data = data_features, 
+   col_samples = "ID_sample", 
+   transformation = TRUE, transformation_method = "InvRank")

## Transformation using InvRank 
### total feature(s) excluded = 0 
### total sample(s) excluded = 0 
# returning a list of data and exclusion IDs
```

### Sample outlier exclusions based on PCA and LOF

```{r eval=FALSE}
> data_processed <- process_data(
+   data = data_features, 
+   col_samples = "ID_sample", 
+   exclusion_extreme_feature = TRUE, missing_pct_feature = 0.1,
+   exclusion_extreme_sample = TRUE, missing_pct_sample = 0.1,
+   imputation = TRUE, imputation_method = "mean",
+   outlier = TRUE)

# Exclusion features: excluding features with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion features: excluded 44 feature(s) 
# Exclusion samples: excluding samples with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion samples: excluded 15 sample(s) 
## Imputation using mean 
# Outlier exclusion using PCA and LOF 
## Excluded 0 sample(s)
## Creating sample outlier plot
### total feature(s) excluded = 44 
### total sample(s) excluded = 15 
# returning a list of data, outlier plot, and exclusion IDs
```

The outlier function creates a PCA plot where samples are coloured by
their LOF. As an example, we can introduce an outlier sample by
multiplying all feature values for ID_10 by 1.5:

```{r eval=FALSE}
> data_features_outlier <- data_features %>%
+   dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(2:101, ~ ifelse(dplyr::row_number() == 10, . * 1.5, .)))
> data_processed <- process_data(
+   data = data_features_outlier,
+   col_samples = "ID_sample", 
+   exclusion_extreme_feature = TRUE, missing_pct_feature = 0.1,
+   exclusion_extreme_sample = TRUE, missing_pct_sample = 0.1,
+   imputation = TRUE, imputation_method = "mean",
+   outlier = TRUE)

# Exclusion features: excluding features with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion features: excluded 44 feature(s) 
# Exclusion samples: excluding samples with more than 10% missingness 
## Exclusion samples: excluded 15 sample(s) 
## Imputation using mean 
# Outlier exclusion using PCA and LOF 
## Excluded 1 sample(s)
## Creating sample outlier plot
### total feature(s) excluded = 44 
### total sample(s) excluded = 16 
# returning a list of data, outlier plot, and exclusion IDs
```

### Plate correction

You can perform plate correction by providing sample and feature
meta-data files.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data_processed <- process_data(
  data = data_features, 
  data_meta_samples = data_meta_samples,
  col_samples = "ID_sample", 
  data_meta_features = data_meta_features,
  col_features = "ID_feature",
  plate_correction = TRUE, 
  cols_listRandom = c("batch"), 
  cols_listFixedToKeep = c("age"), 
  cols_listFixedToRemove = c("sex"), 
  col_HeteroSked = NULL)
```

### Other

Centering and scaling can be performed using `centre_scale = TRUE`.
Centering and scaling is performed for log based transformations at the
point of the transformation, regardless of if `centre_scale = TRUE`.

If you are processing case-control data then you will likely want to
ensure excluded samples have their matched samples also excluded. This
can be done using `case_control = TRUE` and providing the column name in
`data_meta_samples` which has the matching factor, `col_case_control =
case_control_match`.

The processed data, the IDs for excluded samples and features and the
reasons for exclusions, and the outlier plot can be saved using `save =
TRUE` and providing a file path for the processed data (`path_out =
path/to/directory/`) and the exclusion data (`path_outliers =
path/to/directory/exclusions/`)
