\title{Hybrid Imputation: Random Forest + LCMD}
\usage{
hybrid_imputation(
  df,
  target_cols = NULL,
  is_qc = NULL,
  method = c("RF-LCMD"),
  oobe_threshold = 0.1,
  control_RF = list(),
  control_LCMD = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with samples (rows) and features (columns).}

\item{target_cols}{A character vector of column names or a single regular expression to identify target columns for imputation. If NULL, all columns are considered.}

\item{is_qc}{A logical vector indicating which rows are QC samples. Must match \code{nrow(df)}.}

\item{method}{Imputation strategy to use (currently only \code{"RF-LCMD"} supported).}

\item{oobe_threshold}{Numeric. Features with OOBE below this threshold will use RF, others will use LCMD.}

\item{control_RF}{A named list of control arguments for \code{missForest::missForest()}. Also supports \code{n_cores} (internal).}

\item{control_LCMD}{A named list of control arguments for \code{imputeLCMD::impute.MAR.MNAR()}, including \code{mode = "overall"} or \code{"column-wise"}.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{hybrid_rf_lcmd}{The fully imputed data frame combining RF and LCMD decisions.}
\item{rf}{The RF-imputed data frame (non-QC rows only, in full column structure).}
\item{lcmd}{The LCMD-imputed data frame (non-QC rows only, in full column structure).}
\item{oob}{A named numeric vector of feature-level OOB errors from RF.}
}
}
\description{
This function performs hybrid imputation on selected columns of a data frame by combining
Random Forest (RF) imputation (via \code{missForest}) and left-censored missing data (LCMD)
imputation (via \code{imputeLCMD}). It selects the method per feature based on the
out-of-bag error (OOBE) from the RF model.
