\description{
A simulated dataframe with 100 rows and 101 columns. Col1 is an ID column.
The remaining columns are features with randomly assigned values. Once values
were assigned, feature missingness was introduced (5 percent) randomly for feature_2-feature_92.
feature_93-feature_100 contains missing at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 perceent, respectively.
Sample missingness was then intriduced for ID_90-ID_100 at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 perceent, respectively.
Missing values for ID_1 were then replaced with the mean of the feature to give ID_1 no missingness
