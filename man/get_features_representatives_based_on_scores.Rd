\title{Select representative features per cluster based on scores}
\usage{
get_features_representatives_based_on_scores(cluster_feature_list, scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluster_feature_list}{A list where each element is a character vector of feature names
belonging to one cluster. Each element must be a non-empty character
vector.}

\item{scores}{A named numeric vector where names correspond to feature names and
values represent feature scores. All features appearing in
\code{cluster_feature_list} must be present in \code{names(scores)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:

\describe{
\item{\code{representatives}}{
A character vector giving one selected representative feature
per cluster.
}
\item{\code{representatives_map}}{
A named list mapping each representative feature to the vector
of original features in its cluster.
}
}
}
\description{
For each cluster, this function selects a single representative feature.
If a cluster contains one feature, that feature is selected. If it contains
multiple features, the feature with the highest score in \code{scores} is
selected.
}
\details{
The function also returns a named list mapping each representative feature
to all cluster members it represents.
}
\examples{
cluster_feature_list <- list(
  c("feat_a", "feat_b", "feat_c"),
  "feat_d",
  c("feat_e", "feat_f")

  feat_a = 0.1,
  feat_b = 0.4,
  feat_c = 0.3,
  feat_d = 0.9,
  feat_e = 0.2,
  feat_f = 0.8
