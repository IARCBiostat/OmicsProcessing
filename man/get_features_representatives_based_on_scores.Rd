\title{Select representative features per cluster using correlation threshold and scores}
\usage{
get_features_representatives_based_on_scores(
  df,
  cluster_feature_list,
  corr_thresh,
  scores
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the feature columns referenced in
\code{cluster_feature_list}. Column names must match the feature names.}

\item{cluster_feature_list}{A list where each element is a non-empty character vector of feature names
belonging to one cluster (e.g., the output of a prior clustering step).}

\item{corr_thresh}{A numeric threshold in \code{[0, 1]}. For two-feature clusters, if
\code{|cor| >= corr_thresh}, the feature with the highest score is selected.
For clusters with more than two features, subclusters are created by cutting
the hierarchical tree at \code{h = 1 - corr_thresh}.}

\item{scores}{A named numeric vector of feature scores. All features appearing in
\code{cluster_feature_list} must be present in \code{names(scores)}.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{\code{representatives}}{
A character vector of selected representative features (one per
single-feature cluster; zero, one, or more per multi-feature cluster,
depending on the correlation structure and threshold).
}
\item{\code{representatives_map}}{
A named list mapping each representative feature (when uniquely chosen)
to the character vector of features it represents.
}
}
}
\description{
This function selects representative features from pre-defined clusters of
variables, using a correlation-based rule and a scoring vector:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item If a cluster contains a single feature, that feature is selected.
\item If a cluster contains two features, the absolute pairwise correlation
is computed. If \code{|cor| >= corr_thresh}, only the highest-scoring
feature is selected; otherwise, both features are kept as representatives.
\item If a cluster contains more than two features, hierarchical clustering
is performed using the distance \code{1 - |cor|} with
\code{method = "average"}. The dendrogram is cut at
\code{h = 1 - corr_thresh} to form subclusters. From each subcluster,
the highest-scoring feature is selected as the representative.
}

In all cases where a unique representative is chosen for a (sub)cluster,
\code{representatives_map} stores the mapping from the representative feature
to the set of original features it represents.

For clusters of size greater than two, the distance matrix is computed as
\code{1 - abs(cor(X))} on the selected columns, followed by
\code{hclust(..., method = "average")}. Subclusters are extracted via
\code{cutree(hc, h = 1 - corr_thresh)}. Within each subcluster, the
representative is the feature with the maximum score.

When a two-feature cluster has \code{|cor| < corr_thresh}, both features
are returned as representatives and no mapping is stored for that pair,
as neither represents the other by design.
