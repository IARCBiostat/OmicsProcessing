\title{Filter columns by missingness threshold}
\usage{
filter_columns(data, mask_qc, target_cols, col_thresh, non_target_cols)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame to filter.}

\item{mask_qc}{Logical vector indicating QC rows. These rows are excluded
from the column-wise missingness calculation.}

\item{target_cols}{Character vector of column names to assess for filtering.}

\item{col_thresh}{Maximum allowed missingness in a column (0â€“1).}

\item{non_target_cols}{Character vector of column names that are always
retained regardless of missingness.}
}
\value{
A filtered data frame with selected target columns removed.
}
\description{
Filters columns in a data frame by calculating the proportion of missing
values in the selected target columns, excluding QC samples. Only target
columns with missingness less than or equal to the column threshold are kept.
All non-target columns are always retained.
