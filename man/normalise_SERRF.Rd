\title{SERRF Normalization}
\usage{
normalise_SERRF(
  df,
  target_cols = NULL,
  is_qc = NULL,
  strata_col = NULL,
  num_screen_SERRF = 10,
  seed = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or tibble.}

\item{target_cols}{Feature columns to normalize (character vector or selector passed to \code{resolve_target_cols}).}

\item{is_qc}{Logical vector indicating which rows are QC samples. Must be the same length as the number of rows in \code{df}.}

\item{strata_col}{Name of the column containing batch/strata IDs. If \code{NULL}, a dummy
single-level strata is created so all samples are treated as one batch. When
provided, the column must exist in \code{df} with no NA values.}

\item{num_screen_SERRF}{Number of correlated features to use in model fitting. Default is 10.}

\item{seed}{Set a random number generator seed, default 0.}
}
\value{
A normalized data frame.
}
\description{
Applies the SERRF normalization method to remove unwanted variation (Fan 2019, Anal Chem).
